<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Smart Medic is an applet made for the Development and Analysis of Systems course at Federal University of Santa Catarina. 
At this course we learned more about different UML diagrams and general good practices when it comes to developing a system with user interactions. You can see more [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EPG1g6U9kWaB4rW-Mcp5I157GPqa_H7b/view?usp=sharing).
The applet in itself is a simple system concept for medics to prescribe treatments for patients online (Inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic). It would
also help about with lines and cues in hospitals and other healthcare facilities which is a big problem in Brazil.
